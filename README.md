# gaia-infrastructure

This is an infrastructure directory containing code which will be applied to the gaia deployment.

Note: Right now this is running over `gaia.cronohub.org`. So namespaces and information as such is
coded to point to that location. However, this will change once it's deployed under the proper domain.

This also means that ingress and networking and such will not be contained in this repository.
